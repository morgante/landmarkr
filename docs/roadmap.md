Application Goals
======

### Version 1
When you go to the site, you will be presented with:
* A search box to find a location you want to navigate to.
* A map where you can click to pin the location on the map.
* A button for current location
When you have selected a location, either by pinning or searching, the app will serve up a textual landmark navigation point.

For example:
> NYU Abu Dhabi

> Behind the Mosque in the Old Fish Market

You would then convey this information to another party who needs to find it (such as a delivery person or otherwise).
If they don't recognize the landmark directions, there's a button to "try again" which will use the next most reliable landmark.

Features:
* Find mosque
* Find area
* Find orientation between "road" or another landmark

### Version 2
The same as version 1, except there's a button to click for "navigation directions."

> At the mosque, turn right.

> Proceed 1km

> Your destination is on your left.

### Version 4
